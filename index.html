            <p>Hello gamers! (and non-gamers). Here is a little bit about my personal life. I am known by my in-game name, genuine or genuine756, in
                in the games that I play. On my free time, I like to play video games and try new foods. In addition to video games, I like to stream myself
                on Twitch playing video games, I mostly play Valorant, a FPS shooter by Riot Games. I used to play semi-professionally on the woman's circuit
                but then I got busy with school. Now, I just play for fun and make videos to Youtube and Tiktok sometimes. For trying new foods,
                I'm always down to try something new (that I'm not allergic to!) and San Diego is full of them so feel free to drop any restaurant recommendations
                in the contact form below!
